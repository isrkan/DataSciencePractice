    "# Hypothetical document embedding (HyDE) in document retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement a Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) system for document retrieval. The purpose of HyDE is to transform a query question into a detailed hypothetical document, which can bridge the gap between short queries and long, complex documents in the vector space. This approach improves the retrieval of relevant documents, especially when the query is brief but the document is detailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional retrieval systems often face a problem known as the semantic gap. A short user query might not match the longer documents well in the vector space. HyDE solves this by expanding the query into a more comprehensive, hypothetical document that answers the question in detail. This helps the query's vector representation to better match the documents in the retrieval process."
