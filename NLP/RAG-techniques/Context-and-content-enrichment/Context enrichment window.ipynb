    "# Context enrichment window for document retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use a context enrichment window technique for document retrieval in a vector database. Traditional vector search systems, such as FAISS, return isolated chunks of text based on the query. These chunks may lack surrounding context, making it difficult to fully understand the information. The aim is to improve the quality of search results by retrieving not only relevant chunks but also their neighboring chunks, providing more context for understanding the retrieved information.\n",
