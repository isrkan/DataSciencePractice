# RAG Techniques

This directory contains my practical implementations of various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques in NLP. It serves as a personal learning repository where I experiment with different approaches to improve information retrieval and question answering systems. It contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover various approaches for building, optimizing, and enhancing RAG systems for different data formats and retrieval challenges.


## Notebooks overview

### **Basic RAG systems**
- **PDF retrieval**: Build a simple RAG pipeline using OpenAI embeddings and FAISS to retrieve content from PDF documents.
- **CSV retrieval**: Extend the same pipeline for structured CSV data.

### **Query enhancement**
- **Query transformation**: Apply techniques like paraphrasing and expansion to improve the relevance and comprehensiveness of retrieved information.
- **HyDE (hypothetical document embeddings)**: Transform brief queries into detailed hypothetical documents to better match longer, complex documents in the vector space.

### **Context and content enrichment**
- **Context enrichment window**: Retrieve relevant document chunks along with their neighboring content for improved context comprehension.
- **Contextual compression**: Use LLMs to extract only the most relevant text snippets, avoiding the noise of large chunks.
- **Semantic chunking**: Split documents into meaningful semantic units instead of fixed-size chunks, preserving information coherence.

### **Indexing**
- **Hierarchical indices**: Improve retrieval from long documents by summarizing and indexing at multiple levels (summaries + detailed chunks), combining breadth and depth in retrieval.

### Ranking
- **Fusion retrieval**: Combination of vector-based semantic search with keyword-based BM25 retrieval to leverage both semantic understanding and exact keyword matching for more robust document retrieval.
- **Reranking methods**: Implementation of two reranking strategies using LLMs and cross-encoder models to improve the relevance and quality of initially retrieved documents.

### Explainability and Transparency
- **Explainable retrieval**: Implementation of a retrieval system that not only finds relevant documents but also generates natural language explanations for why those documents were selected, making the process more transparent and trustworthy.

### **Iterative techniques**
* **RAG system with feedback loop**: Integrate user feedback to dynamically refine document relevance and improve answer quality over time — ideal for adaptive systems like education or support bots.
* **Adaptive RAG system**: Automatically classify query types (e.g., factual, opinion, contextual) and choose the most suitable retrieval strategy using LLMs.
* **Self-RAG system with internal reasoning**: Implements a multi-step, decision-aware RAG pipeline with internal checkpoints: it decides whether to retrieve, filters irrelevant contexts, assesses the factual support of generated responses, and scores their utility before choosing the best answer — a lightweight alternative to agentic frameworks.

### **Evaluation**
* **Evaluating RAG systems with DeepEval**: Use the `deepeval` library to assess RAG performance on correctness, contextual faithfulness, and relevance — moving beyond surface-level accuracy.


## Acknowledgements
This work is inspired by and builds upon techniques demonstrated in the excellent [RAG Techniques Repository](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques) of Nir Diamant. I have implemented these techniques as part of my learning journey to deepen my understanding of RAG systems and organize the concepts in a structured way.

## Purpose
This folder serves as both a personal reference and practice ground for RAG techniques that I have studied and implemented. Some techniques are direct applications from the original guide, while others include my own experimentations and modifications.
