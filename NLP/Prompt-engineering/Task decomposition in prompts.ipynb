    "## Task decomposition in prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores task decomposition in prompt engineering, a technique that breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This approach is key to effectively leveraging LLMs for multi-step reasoning tasks. By decomposing a problem into simpler parts, we improve the model's ability to produce more reliable, accurate, and interpretable results.\n",

    "While AI language models are increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, they perform best when provided with clear, structured instructions. Task decomposition simplifies complex problems, allowing the model to focus on one element at a time, leading to better outcomes. This not only enhances the model's performance but also improves the interpretability and reliability of the results.\n",

      "\\text{Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n",

      "### Analysis of Profitability\n",
      "\n",
      "A profit margin of **20%** indicates that the company retains 20 cents of profit for every dollar of revenue generated. This is a strong profit margin, suggesting that the company is effectively managing its costs and expenses relative to its sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Points:\n",
      "1. **Efficiency**: A 20% profit margin typically signifies good operational efficiency. The company is likely controlling its costs well, which is essential for long-term profitability.\n",
      "2. **Comparison**: To further assess the company's performance, it would be useful to compare this profit margin against industry averages or benchmarks. A profit margin that is significantly higher than industry peers could indicate a competitive advantage.\n",
      "3. **Sustainability**: While a strong profit margin is a positive sign, it’s also important to consider the sustainability of this margin over time. Factors such as market conditions, pricing strategies, and cost management practices will influence future profitability.\n",
      "4. **Investment Considerations**: Investors often look at profit margins as part of their decision-making process. A consistent or improving profit margin can lead to increased investor confidence and potentially a higher valuation of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, based on the calculated profit margin of 20%, the company appears to be profitable and well-managed, but ongoing analysis will be necessary to ensure that it remains competitive and sustainable in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liquidity Analysis:\n",
      " To analyze the company's liquidity, we can calculate the **current ratio**. The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to cover its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. It is calculated using the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Given:\n",
      "- Total Assets = $15 million\n",
      "- Total Liabilities = $7 million\n",
      "\n",
      "A more general measure of liquidity can be derived from the **debt-to-equity ratio** or simply analyzing the relationship between assets and liabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Debt-to-Equity Analysis\n",
      "1. **Equity Calculation**:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\text{Equity} = \\text{Total Assets} - \\text{Total Liabilities} = 15\\, \\text{million} - 7\\, \\text{million} = 8\\, \\text{million}\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Equity}} = \\frac{7\\, \\text{million}}{8\\, \\text{million}} = 0.875\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis\n",
      "- **Current Ratio**: Without specific current assets and liabilities, we cannot compute the current ratio directly. However, a high current ratio (typically above 1) indicates good short-term financial health. \n",
      "- **Total Assets to Total Liabilities**: The company has $15 million in assets against $7 million in liabilities, leading to a significant buffer of assets available to cover liabilities.\n",
      "- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.875**: This suggests that the company uses a moderate level of debt compared to equity, which is generally seen as a healthy sign of leverage. A ratio below 1 suggests that the company has more equity than debt, indicating less risk and more financial stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The company's liquidity appears to be strong, with sufficient assets to cover its liabilities. Although we cannot calculate the current ratio directly due to a lack of specific data, the overall financial structure indicated by total assets and liabilities suggests that the company is in a healthy position to meet its obligations. The debt-to-equity ratio further supports this conclusion, indicating a balanced approach to financing with a manageable level of debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash Flow Analysis:\n",
      " Based on the provided cash flow from operations of $3 million, we can make several observations regarding the company's cash flow health:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Positive Cash Flow from Operations**: A cash flow from operations amounting to $3 million indicates that the company is generating cash from its core business activities. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that the company is able to cover its operating expenses and potentially reinvest in growth or distribute returns to shareholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sustainability**: To assess the overall health of the cash flow, it's important to look at the sustainability of this cash flow level. If the $3 million is consistent over multiple periods and aligns with the company's revenue trends, it suggests a stable operational performance. However, if it fluctuates significantly or is a one-time occurrence, it may raise concerns about the reliability of cash generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Comparison to Industry Norms**: Analyzing this figure against industry benchmarks can provide additional insights. If the cash flow from operations is higher than industry peers, it may indicate a competitive advantage or effective management. Conversely, if it lags behind, it might highlight operational inefficiencies or market challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Investment and Financing Needs**: A healthy cash flow from operations can afford the company flexibility in investments and financing. The company can use this cash to fund capital expenditures, pay down debt, or return value to shareholders. If the $3 million is sufficient to meet these needs without relying on external financing, it further strengthens the cash flow health.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Further Analysis Required**: While $3 million in cash flow from operations is a positive indicator, a more comprehensive analysis would require additional information, such as cash flows from investing and financing activities, net income, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital. This would provide a clearer picture of the company's overall cash flow dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the company's cash flow from operations of $3 million is a positive indicator of operational health, but further context and comparative analysis are necessary for a full assessment of its cash flow health.\n"

The function creates a prompt that presents all three analyses to the language model and asks it to synthesize the key points from each one and provide an overall evaluation.\n",
    "2. Prompt design: The prompt is designed to be comprehensive and detailed. It includes placeholders for the results of the three analyses (profitability, liquidity, and cash flow). The model is asked to summarize the key points from each analysis and then provide an overarching evaluation of the company’s financial health. This prompt allows the model to process and integrate multiple aspects of the company's financial situation, leading to a cohesive and informative output.\n",
