    "# Self-consistency and multiple paths of reasoning\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore a strategy for improving the reliability and quality of responses from LLMs: generating multiple reasoning paths and using self-consistency as a way to evaluate and refine the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "While large language models like GPT are powerful, they may not always give the correct or most consistent answer on the first try—especially for tasks that involve complex reasoning, multiple steps, or some ambiguity. One way to make their responses more dependable is to ask them to solve the same problem in multiple ways. By generating several independent reasoning paths and comparing them, we can better identify patterns, avoid mistakes, and surface the most consistent and trustworthy answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique has several advantages. It helps reduce variability and randomness in outputs, exposes possible reasoning flaws, and makes the model’s thought process more transparent. When combined with a method for aggregating results and evaluating their internal consistency, it becomes a practical way to boost both the accuracy and interpretability of model responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is especially helpful for quantitative problem solving, conceptual explanations, open-ended reasoning tasks."

In this case, the final velocity \\(v\\) at the maximum height is 0 m/s, the initial velocity \\(u\\) is 20 m/s, and the acceleration \\(a\\) is -9.81 m/s² (due to gravity). The calculations based on these values should yield a height of approximately 20.39 meters. \n",
      "   - Similarly, the energy conservation approach correctly equates kinetic energy (\\(\\frac{1}{2}mu^2\\)) to potential energy (\\(mgh\\)), leading to the same conclusion. This adherence to fundamental physics principles further supports the result.\n",

      "Aggregated Result:\n",
      " The most consistent answer across all three reasoning paths is that the capital of France is **Paris**. Each reasoning path effectively highlights different aspects that lead to the same conclusion, emphasizing the city's historical, cultural, and political significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reasoning Path 1** focuses on the recognition of Paris through its iconic landmarks and its role as the political and administrative center, mentioning specific institutions like the presidential palace and the National Assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reasoning Path 2** takes a broader approach, discussing geographical and cultural contexts, and highlights historical events, further supporting the idea of Paris as the capital through its identity as the \"City of Light\" and its central role in French history.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reasoning Path 3** dives into historical context and linguistic connections, reinforcing Paris's importance not only as a capital but also as a symbol of French culture and history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the different angles taken in each path, all lead to the same conclusion: Paris is the capital of France. There are no discrepancies in the reasoning, as they all consistently support the same answer. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is **Paris**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistency Evaluation:\n",
      " The evaluation of the provided result regarding the capital of France, identified as **Paris**, can be assessed based on several factors, including logical consistency, adherence to known facts, and potential biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Logical Consistency**\n",
      "The reasoning paths presented are logically consistent in their support for the conclusion that Paris is the capital of France. Each path addresses different dimensions—political, cultural, historical—yet they converge on the same factual answer. The absence of contradictions among the reasoning paths strengthens the overall argument, making it coherent and robust.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Adherence to Known Facts**\n",
      "The answer aligns perfectly with established knowledge: Paris is indeed the capital of France. The reasoning paths correctly reference the city's role as the political hub (mentioning institutions like the presidential palace and National Assembly), its cultural significance (the \"City of Light\"), and its historical context. All these elements are factual and widely recognized, affirming the reliability of the conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Potential Biases**\n",
      "While the reasoning paths provide a well-rounded view of Paris, one could argue that there might be a slight bias toward emphasizing the grandeur and significance of the city. However, this is not necessarily a negative aspect when discussing a capital city, as it naturally invites discussions about its importance.

      "Aggregated Result:\n",
      " The most consistent answer regarding the explanation of supply and demand across the three reasoning paths lies in the fundamental principles illustrated through each narrative. Each path effectively communicates the essential concepts of supply and demand, albeit through different methods—visualization with everyday scenarios, metaphorical dance, and narrative storytelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Consistencies in the Reasoning Paths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Definition of Supply and Demand**:\n",
      "   - All three paths correctly define demand as the consumer's willingness to purchase goods at various price levels and supply as the producer's willingness to sell goods at those price levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Market Equilibrium**:\n",
      "   - Each path illustrates the concept of market equilibrium, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, thereby setting the market price. This is a central theme in all explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Shifts in Demand and Supply**:\n",
      "   - The explanations acknowledge that external factors (like health trends, competition, and production costs) can shift the demand and supply curves, impacting prices and quantities in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Price Adjustments**:\n",
      "   - The narratives emphasize that when demand increases or supply decreases, prices tend to rise, and conversely, when supply increases or demand decreases, prices tend to fall. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dynamic Nature of the Market**:\n",
      "   - Each path recognizes that supply and demand are not static; they are affected by various factors over time, reflecting a dynamic market environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discrepancies and Clarifications:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Method of Explanation**:\n",
      "  - The first path uses everyday scenarios (e.g., a coffee shop), the second employs a metaphorical dance, and the third follows a narrative story of a farmer. While these methods differ, they are not inherently contradictory; rather, they provide diverse perspectives on the same economic principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Complexity of External Factors**:\n",
      "  - The metaphorical dance might overly simplify the complexities involved in market dynamics, while the narrative approach of the farmer introduces specific examples of external factors (like health benefits), which provide a clearer context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the most consistent answer reflects that supply and demand are fundamental economic concepts that describe the interactions between consumers and producers in a market. They determine prices and quantities, influenced by various external factors, and are best understood through relatable examples, metaphors, or narratives. Each reasoning path successfully conveys these principles, with the narrative of the farmer providing the most relatable and illustrative context for understanding the dynamics of supply and demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistency Evaluation:\n",
      " The evaluation of the provided result regarding the explanation of supply and demand in economics reveals several strengths and areas for improvement in terms of consistency, reliability, and clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Logical Consistency**:\n",
      "   - The result maintains a coherent structure throughout, clearly delineating key concepts of supply and demand such as definitions, market equilibrium, shifts in demand and supply, price adjustments, and the dynamic nature of the market. This logical flow enhances the clarity of the explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adherence to Known Facts**:\n",
      "   - The definitions of supply and demand, as well as the concept of market equilibrium, align well with established economic principles. The acknowledgment of external factors affecting supply and demand demonstrates an understanding of the complexities that govern market behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Diverse Perspectives**:\n",
      "   - The use of different methods (everyday scenarios, metaphorical dance, narrative storytelling) to explain the concepts caters to varied learning styles. This diversity can enhance comprehension by providing multiple angles from which to understand the same principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Potential Simplification**:\n",
      "   - While the metaphorical dance approach attempts to convey complex ideas, it runs the risk of oversimplifying intricate economic mechanisms. More explicit connections to fundamental economic principles would enhance the reliability of this method. It’s essential to balance creativity with accuracy to avoid misinterpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complexity of External Factors**:\n",
      "   - The result mentions external factors impacting supply and demand but does not delve deeply into how these factors interact. For instance, discussing specific examples of shifts—such as technological advancements or changes in consumer preferences—could provide a more nuanced understanding and strengthen the explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Narrative Context**:\n",
      "   - While the farmer's narrative is described as relatable, the evaluation lacks specific examples from this narrative that illustrate the points made. Including concrete instances would not only enhance reliability but also enrich the reader's understanding of how real-world scenarios manifest in economic terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the result demonstrates a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts of supply and demand and presents them in an engaging way. The logical consistency and adherence to known economic facts contribute to a reliable explanation. However, there is room for improvement in balancing creative methods with the need for depth and clarity, particularly regarding the complexities of external factors and the use of concrete examples. Strengthening these areas would enhance the overall effectiveness and reliability of the explanation.\n",

      "Aggregated Result:\n",
      " All three reasoning paths arrive at the same conclusion: it will take the train **3 hours** to cover 180 kilometers at a speed of 60 km/h. Each path employs a slightly different approach but ultimately leads to the same result through consistent application of the fundamental relationship between distance, speed, and time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis of Discrepancies\n",
      "There are no discrepancies among the reasoning paths. Each path effectively communicates the necessary components and calculations required to solve the problem. Here’s a brief recap of the consistency across the reasoning paths:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reasoning Path 1**:\n",
      "   - Identifies the components and directly applies the formula for time.\n",
      "   - Arrives at the answer through a straightforward calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reasoning Path 2**:\n",
      "   - Takes a different approach by breaking down the speed in terms of distance covered per hour.\n",
      "   - Uses a division approach to find how many full hours it takes, leading to the same answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reasoning Path 3**:\n",
      "   - Begins with a conceptual understanding of the relationship between speed, distance, and time.\n",
      "   - Re-arranges the formula and performs the calculation in a clear manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Since all three paths correctly apply logical reasoning and calculations to arrive at the same answer, the most consistent answer is indeed **3 hours**. There are no discrepancies to address, and the reasoning is sound across all approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistency Evaluation:\n",
      " The evaluation of the result and the reasoning paths reveals a high degree of consistency and reliability in arriving at the conclusion that it will take the train **3 hours** to cover 180 kilometers at a speed of 60 km/h. Here are the factors considered in the evaluation:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Logical Consistency\n",
      "- **Correct Application of Formula**: All reasoning paths correctly utilize the fundamental relationship between distance, speed, and time given by the formula: \n",
      "  \\[\n",
      "  \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}.\n",
      "  \\]\n",
      "  In this case, substituting the values gives:\n",
      "  \\[\n",
      "  \\text{Time} = \\frac{180 \\text{ km}}{60 \\text{ km/h}} = 3 \\text{ hours}.\n",
      "  \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Multiple Approaches**: The three different reasoning paths reflect various methods of solving the problem, yet all converge on the same answer, which reinforces the reliability of the conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adherence to Known Facts\n",
      "- **Distance and Speed Values**: The fact that the train travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h and needs to cover a distance of 180 km are both factual and straightforward, ensuring that the calculations are grounded in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Time Calculation**: The calculation of time based on the given speed and distance is a well-established method in physics and mathematics, further supporting the reliability of the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Biases\n",
      "- **Confirmation Bias**: There is no indication of confirmation bias in the reasoning paths since they approach the problem from different angles and still arrive at the same result. This diversity in reasoning minimizes the risk of bias in the conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clarity and Transparency**: Each path clearly explains its reasoning and calculations, which adds to the reliability of the result. There are no hidden assumptions or unclear steps that could lead to misinterpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Overall, the evaluation confirms that the result of **3 hours** is not only consistent among the different reasoning paths but also reliable based on the logical application of known formulas and facts. The absence of discrepancies and the clarity of the reasoning further strengthen the confidence in this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is robust and trustworthy for the given problem.\n",
