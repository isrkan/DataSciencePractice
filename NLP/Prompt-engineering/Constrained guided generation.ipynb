    "# Constrained and guided generation with language models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the concepts of constrained and guided generation using large language models. Instead of letting the model freely generate text, we structure and restrict the generation process to produce more precise, rule-abiding, and goal-oriented outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs like GPT are flexible and creative, that flexibility can sometimes be a drawback. Left to generate text freely, the model may:\n",
    "- Drift off-topic.\n",
    "- Produce verbose or inconsistent content.\n",
    "- Fail to meet specific format or length requirements.\n",
    "- Can be too creative when we need something structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "This becomes especially problematic in real-world use cases where consistency, structure, and clarity are essential — such as in product descriptions, job postings, data extraction, and UI text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where constrained generation shines — it helps us steer the model with a clear format, rules, and validation mechanisms. This approach not only improves the usability and accuracy of the generated text, but also makes LLMs better suited for integration into structured workflows and applications where format adherence is non-negotiable."

    "1. Prompt construction with multi-step constraints: The prompt includes detailed rules governing the structure, quantity, and length of the generated review content. The constraints apply not only to the sections (e.g., number of pros and cons), but also to the sentence count per item and total word count. A clear format is enforced so the model knows exactly how to arrange its output.\n",
    "2. Input customization: The dictionary `input_variables` defines the parameters for a particular product review. This makes the template reusable — the same prompt logic can be applied to any product by simply changing the inputs.\n",
    "3. Chain execution: The prompt is connected to the language model via a LangChain `Runnable` (represented by `| llm`), and the final output is generated using `.invoke()` with the defined parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how to simulate programmatic control over free-form generation by using prompt engineering alone — no post-processing or external validators are needed to enforce rules. With clear formatting and quantified constraints, models like GPT can reliably produce content that fits highly structured specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique can be extended to more complex domains, such as report generation, automated assessments, or personalized recommendations — any case where the output must satisfy a format contract or domain-specific checklist."
