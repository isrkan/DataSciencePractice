# Prompt Engineering Techniques

This directory contains my practical explorations and implementations of various prompt engineering techniques used in LLMs. It serves as a personal learning repository where I experiment with different strategies to optimize model performance, guide generation behavior, and adapt responses to specific tasks or user intents.

The techniques covered span a wide range of prompt design principles, from basic formulations to more advanced structures for complex applications. These include methods for improving instruction clarity, injecting domain-specific context, handling multi-turn interactions, constraining output formats, and more. The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of how prompt phrasing influences model behavior across different use cases in natural language processing.

## Acknowledgements

This work is inspired by and builds upon techniques demonstrated in the excellent [Prompt Engineering Techniques Repository](https://github.com/NirDiamant/Prompt_Engineering) of Nir Diamant. I have adapted and extended the ideas for prompt engineering as part of my own learning journey to better understand and structure the principles involved in effective prompt design.

## Purpose

This folder serves as both a personal reference and practice ground for prompt engineering techniques that I have studied, applied, and in some cases, modified. It reflects an ongoing process of experimentation, iteration, and refinement in leveraging LLMs more effectively through thoughtful prompt construction.
