# AI Agents

This directory contains my practical implementations of various AI agents designed to perform autonomous or semi-autonomous tasks using modern language models. It includes a range of Jupyter notebooks experimenting with agent design patterns, tool integrations, and task-oriented reasoning pipelines.

## Acknowledgements
This work is inspired by and builds upon applications demonstrated in the excellent [GenAI Agents Repository](https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents) of Nir Diamant. I have implemented these approaches as part of my learning process to better understand agent frameworks and their practical applications.

## Purpose
This folder acts as both a personal reference and practice ground for different types of AI agents that I have experimented and implemented. Some agents are direct applications from the original guide, while others include my own experimentations and modifications.
