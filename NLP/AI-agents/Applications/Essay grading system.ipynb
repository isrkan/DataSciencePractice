    "# Essay grading system\n",
    "\n",
    "Essay grading is a time-intensive task that requires evaluating multiple dimensions of writing quality - from basic grammar and structure to more nuanced aspects like relevance and analytical depth. While human graders bring invaluable expertise to this process, they can also introduce inconsistency and are limited by time constraints when dealing with large volumes of essays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an intelligent essay grading agent that leverages LLMs and graph-based workflows to automate the evaluation process. Rather than treating essay grading as a single monolithic task, we break it down into distinct evaluation components - relevance, grammar, structure, and depth of analysis - each handled by specialized functions within a conditional workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to simulate a nuanced and modular grading process that mirrors how a human evaluator might approach scoring essays—but built using a graph-based logic where the grading path adapts based on intermediate results."
