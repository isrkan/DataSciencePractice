    "# Self-improving agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional AI chatbots operate with static knowledge - they respond based on their training data but don't evolve from conversations. This creates a fundamental limitation: they can't adapt to user preferences, learn from mistakes, or improve their responses over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an AI agent that breaks this limitation by implementing a continuous learning loop. The agent doesn't just respond to queries; it actively reflects on its performance, identifies areas for improvement, and incorporates these insights into future interactions. Think of it as creating an AI that learns from experience, similar to how humans refine their communication skills through practice and feedback.\n",
    "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Foundation**: Paris was originally a small Gallic settlement called Lutetia, founded around the 3rd century BC by the Parisii tribe. It was situated on the Île de la Cité, an island in the Seine River.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Roman Period**: The city became an important Roman city during the 1st century AD. It was known as Lutetia and featured typical Roman architecture, including baths, temples, and an amphitheater.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Middle Ages**: After the fall of the Roman Empire, Paris grew in importance, becoming the capital of the Frankish kingdom. The construction of Notre-Dame Cathedral began in the 12th century, symbolizing the city's growing power. By the 13th century, Paris was a major cultural and intellectual center in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Renaissance and Enlightenment**: The 16th and 17th centuries saw Paris flourish as a center for art, literature, and philosophy. This period included the construction of the Louvre and the rise of influential thinkers like Descartes and Voltaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **French Revolution**: In 1789, Paris was the epicenter of the French Revolution, leading to significant political and social changes in France. The storming of the Bastille is one of the most famous events associated with this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **19th Century**: The city underwent extensive modernization under Baron Haussmann in the mid-19th century, resulting in wide boulevards and new public spaces. This period also saw the rise of the Eiffel Tower, which was completed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **World Wars**: Paris was occupied by German forces during World War I and again during World War II. After the liberation of Paris in 1944, the city rebuilt and emerged as a symbol of resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Modern Era**: Today, Paris is known for its cultural significance, iconic landmarks, and as a global center for fashion, art, and cuisine. It continues to attract millions of visitors each year.\n",

      "- **Design**: The Eiffel Tower is made of iron and consists of three levels, with restaurants and observation decks offering stunning views of the city.\n",

      "- **History**: Originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century under King Philip II, it was transformed into a royal palace before becoming a public museum during the French Revolution in 1793.\n",
      "- **Collections**: The Louvre houses over 380,000 objects, including some of the most famous artworks in history, such as Leonardo da Vinci's **Mona Lisa** and the ancient Greek statue **Venus de Milo**.\n",
      "- **Architecture**: The museum is known for its iconic glass pyramid entrance, designed by architect I. M. Pei, which was completed in 1989 and has become a symbol of the museum.\n",
