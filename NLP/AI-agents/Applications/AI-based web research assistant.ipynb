    "In today's digital landscape, researchers, analysts, and professionals face the challenge of quickly extracting meaningful insights from vast amounts of online information. Traditional web searching often results in information scattered across multiple sources, requiring significant time to read through and synthesize. This notebook presents an intelligent solution that automates the research process by combining web search capabilities with language model-based summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system addresses the core problem of information overload by automatically searching the web for relevant content and generating concise, actionable summaries. Rather than manually browsing through dozens of search results, users can obtain key insights from multiple sources in a structured format, dramatically reducing research time while maintaining information quality. The tool leverages DuckDuckGo's search API for web queries and OpenAI's language models for intelligent summarization.\n"
