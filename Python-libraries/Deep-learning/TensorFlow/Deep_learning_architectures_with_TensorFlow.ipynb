    "In TensorFlow, defining a neural network model involves specifying the architecture of layers in a sequential manner. \n",
    "- **Defining a sequential model** (`Sequential()`): The sequential model in TensorFlow's keras API is a linear stack of layers. This means that each layer in the model is added one after the other. It's a straightforward way to build a model when the architecture can be described as a simple chain of layers, where the output of one layer is the input to the next.\n",
    "- **Adding layers to the model**: Each neural network layer is added to the model sequentially using the `add()` method. The most common type of layer in FFNNs is the dense layer. The general syntax:\n",

    "        - **Activation functions** (`activation`): The activation function that determines how the outputs of the layer are transformed before being passed to the next layer. Common activation functions include `'relu'` for hidden layers and `'sigmoid'` or `'softmax'` for output layers.\n",
    "        - **Input shape** (`input_shape=(n,)`): Defines the shape of the input data. It is only required for the first layer in a sequential model so the model knows what kind of input to expect. `n` is the number of features in the input data. Here, it's `(20,)` indicating that each input sample has 20 features.\n",

Each hidden layer is a dense layer, where each neuron receives input from all the neurons in the previous layer.\n",

    "        - **Activation**: The activation function for the LSTM cell. While the internal mechanisms of LSTM (like the forget gate, input gate, and output gate) use the `sigmoid` and `tanh` functions internally, the outer activation is typically `'tanh'`.\n",
    "        - **Input shape** (`input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim)`): Defines the structure of the input data.\n",
    "            - **Timesteps**: This indicates the number of time steps in the input sequence, essentially representing how many past observations the LSTM should consider.\n",

    "***Multimodal neural network syntax***\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, a multimodal neural network can combine RNN and CNN branches, each processing different types of data before merging their outputs for final predictions. The architecture allows distinct processing paths (RNN for sequence data, CNN for spatial data) that are specialized for their respective inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining RNN and CNN branches:**\n",
    "    - **RNN branch:** Handles sequential data like time series or text.\n",
    "        - **Input layer** (`Input(shape=(timesteps, features))`): The `Input` layer defines the shape of the sequential data, specifying the time steps and the number of features per step. For example, `Input(shape=(10, 8))` expects sequences of 10 time steps, each with 8 features.\n",
    "        - **Recurrent layer** (`RecurrentLayer(units, activation='activation_function')`): Processes the sequential data with recurrent layer e.g., RNN/LSTM/GRU. Units are the number of neurons in the recurrent layer. For example, `SimpleRNN(64, activation='tanh')` adds an LSTM layer with 64 units and a `tanh` activation function.\n",
    "        - **Dense layer** (`Dense(units, activation='activation_function')`): Further processes the output from the recurrent layer.\n",
    "    - **CNN branch:** Handles spatial data like images.\n",
    "        - **Input layer** (`Input(shape=(height, width, channels))`): The `Input` layer defines the shape of the image data, such as `Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))` for 64x64 RGB images.\n",
    "        - **Convolutional layer** (`ConvLayer(filters, kernel_size, activation='activation_function')`): Extracts features from the images by applying filters across the input. Filters are the number of convolutional filters applied and Kernel size is the size of the filter (e.g., 3x3). For example, `Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')` adds a convolutional layer with 32 filters and a 3x3 kernel.\n",
    "        - **Pooling layer** (`PoolingLayer(pool_size)`): Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, helping in downsampling and feature condensation. Pool size is the dimension of the pooling window (e.g., 2x2). For example, `MaxPooling2D((2, 2))`.\n",
    "        - **Flatten layer** (`Flatten()`): Converts the multi-dimensional output of the CNN into a 1D vector for further processing. In our example, it scnverts the 2D output into a 1D vector.\n",
    "        - **Dense layer** (`Dense(units, activation='activation_function')`): Further processes the flattened output.\n",
    "2. **Concatenation of RNN and CNN outputs:** After each branch has processed its respective input data, their outputs are concatenated to form a combined representation that merges the insights from both branches.\n",
    "    - **Concatenate layer** (`Concatenate()([output_rnn, output_cnn])`): The outputs of the RNN and CNN branches are concatenated to form a combined representation.\n",
    "3. **Dense layers and output:**\n",
    "    - **Further dense layers:** After concatenation, additional dense layers can be added to further process the combined data.\n",
    "    - **Output layer:** The final dense layer typically uses a softmax activation function for classification.\n",
    "4. **Model creation and compilation:**\n",
    "    - **Model** (`Model(inputs=[input_rnn, input_cnn], outputs=final_output)`): The `Model` function defines the multimodal model by taking the inputs from both the RNN and CNN branches and defines the output layer (from step 3).\n",
    "    - **Compilation:** The model is compiled using an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. "
