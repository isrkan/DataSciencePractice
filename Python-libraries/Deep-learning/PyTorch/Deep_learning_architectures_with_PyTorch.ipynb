    "#### Understanding the FFNN model syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining the model class**: In PyTorch, a neural network is defined as a class that inherits from `nn.Module`. This class encapsulates the architecture and behavior of the model, including the definition of layers and the forward pass. The model class is essential because it allows PyTorch to manage the model's parameters, layers, and operations seamlessly.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class FFNN(nn.Module):\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            super(FFNN, self).__init__()\n",
    "            # Define layers and operations here\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **`super(FFNN, self).__init__()`**: This line calls the constructor of the parent class (`nn.Module`), initializing the model and allowing PyTorch to keep track of the network's layers and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining layers and operations**:\n",
    "    - **Layer definitions**: In the `__init__` method, the layers of the model are defined. These are typically instances of PyTorch's built-in layer classes, such as `nn.Linear` for fully connected layers. The layers are defined as attributes of the class (`self.fc1`, `self.fc2`, `self.fc3`, etc.), making them part of the model's state.\n",
    "        ```python      \n",
    "        self.fc = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        - **Input and output dimensions**: The parameters of `nn.Linear` define the number of input (`in_features`, the number of neurons in the previous layer) and output (`out_features`, the number of neurons in this layer) features for each layer. For instance, `self.fc1 = nn.Linear(20, 64)` indicates that the first layer takes 20 input features and outputs 64 features.\n",
    "    - **Activation functions**: In this model, activation functions are also defined in the `__init__` method. This is a slight variation from the previous example where activation functions were directly used in the `forward` method without defining them in `__init__`. Here, ReLU (`nn.ReLU()`) and Sigmoid (`nn.Sigmoid()`) are both defined in `__init__` as class attributes.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n",
    "        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        - **Why define activation functions in `__init__`?**: Defining activation functions in `__init__` makes them reusable components of the model. By doing so, we avoid creating a new instance of the activation function every time it is called in the `forward` method, which can be slightly more efficient. This approach also makes the forward pass cleaner and easier to read. Although ReLU is used twice in the `forward` method, it is defined only once in `__init__`. This is because the same ReLU function can be applied multiple times to different layers. There is no need to define separate ReLU instances for each layer unless there is a specific reason to do so (e.g., different parameter settings for different layers).\n",
    "    - **Importance of order**: The order of definition in the `__init__` method is not crucial as long as the layers and operations are properly referenced in the `forward` method. However, it's common practice to define the layers first, followed by any activation functions or other operations. This convention improves code readability and organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining the forward pass**: The `forward` method defines how the input data flows through the network layers and activation functions. This method describes the sequence of operations applied to the input data, transforming it step-by-step through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))  # Apply first layer and ReLU activation\n",
    "        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))  # Apply second layer and ReLU activation\n",
    "        x = self.sigmoid(self.fc3(x))  # Apply final layer and Sigmoid activation\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Sequential Operations**: The operations are applied in sequence, with each layer's output serving as the input to the next layer. ReLU activation is applied after each hidden layer, and Sigmoid is applied at the final output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the training loop structure\n",
    "- Epoch loop: Runs through the entire training dataset for a specified number of epochs.\n",
    "- Batch loop: Divides the dataset into mini-batches, and each batch is processed independently.\n",
    "    - Forward pass: The part of the code where the model makes predictions based on the input data.\n",
    "    - Backward pass: The part of the code where the gradients are calculated and the model parameters are updated.\n",
    "- Validation loss: Calculated after each epoch to monitor how well the model is generalizing to unseen data.\n",
    " - Here we used `torch.inference_mode()` and `torch.no_grad()`, but both are used in PyTorch to disable gradient computation. `torch.no_grad()` only affects gradient computation, whereas `torch.inference_mode()` also disables autograd tracking and performs other optimizations, specifically optimized for inference scenarios.\n",

    "#### Understanding the CNN model syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining the model class**: Like the previous models, the CNN model is defined as a class inheriting from `nn.Module`. This allows PyTorch to manage the layers and operations within the model.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class CNNModel(nn.Module):\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            super(CNNModel, self).__init__()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Defining convolutional blocks**: A convolutional block in a CNN typically consists of a sequence of two main components: a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer. These blocks are the building blocks of CNNs and are stacked to progressively extract higher-level features from the input data, controlling the computational load and focusing on the most important features. The general syntax for defining a Convolutional Block in PyTorch is as follows:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, padding, stride=1, dilation=1)\n",
    "    self.pool = nn.PoolingType(kernel_size, stride)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Convolutional layer** (`nn.Conv2d`):\n",
    "        - **`in_channels`**: The number of channels in the input data (e.g., 1 for grayscale images, 3 for RGB images).\n",
    "        - **`out_channels`**: The number of filters applied by the convolutional layer, resulting in this many output feature maps.\n",
    "        - **`kernel_size`**: The size of the convolutional kernel (e.g., `3x3`), which determines the area of the input that the filter will process at a time.\n",
    "        - **`padding`**: Zero-padding added to the input on both sides to control the output size. Padding helps maintain the same spatial dimensions after convolution.\n",
    "        - **`stride`**: The step size of the convolutional kernel as it moves across the input. By default, this is set to `1`.\n",
    "        - **`dilation`**: The spacing between the kernel points, which allows the receptive field of the convolutional layer to increase without increasing the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "        In the specific model examples:\n",
    "        - **Standard convolution**: Used in the first two blocks, where `padding=1` and `kernel_size=3`, ensuring that the output spatial dimensions remain similar to the input dimensions.\n",
    "        - **Dilated convolution**: Used in the third block with `dilation=2` and `padding=2`, expanding the receptive field to capture more contextual information without increasing the kernel size.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Pooling layer**: Pooling layers down-sample the feature maps produced by the convolutional layer, reducing their spatial dimensions. This helps in reducing the computational complexity and mitigating overfitting by summarizing the presence of features in patches of the feature map. Different pooling methods used in the model include:\n",
    "        - **`nn.MaxPool2d`**: Applies max pooling with a `2x2` kernel and `stride=2`. This pooling operation selects the maximum value from each `2x2` patch, effectively reducing the spatial dimensions by half.\n",
    "        - **`nn.AvgPool2d`**: Instead of taking the maximum value, average pooling computes the average of each `2x2` patch, also with a stride of `2`. This pooling method is useful for smooth down-sampling and can help when the maximum operation is too aggressive.\n",
    "        - **`nn.AdaptiveMaxPool2d`**: An adaptive pooling operation that outputs a fixed-size feature map, regardless of the input size. For example, in the third block, it reduces the feature map to a size of `4x4`, which is useful for ensuring consistent input size to the subsequent fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining flatten layer** (`nn.Flatten`): This layer is used to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector before feeding them into the fully connected layers. This is necessary because fully connected layers expect a flat vector as input.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    self.flatten = nn.Flatten()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Defining fully connected layers** (`nn.Linear`): The fully connected layers reduce the dimensionality of the input step by step, eventually outputting `10` values, one for each class. The first layer takes input corresponding to the flattened vector from the convolutional output (`64` channels * `4x4` feature map).\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 4 * 4, 128)\n",
    "    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)\n",
    "    self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Activation function** (`nn.ReLU`): ReLU activation is applied after each layer (except the final output layer). It introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to learn more complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Defining the forward pass**:\n",
    "    - **Convolutional blocks**: Each convolutional block processes the input sequentially, applying a convolution, activation, and pooling step. The convolutional layers extract hierarchical features from the input data, with each successive layer capturing increasingly complex patterns. This is followed by an activation function, such as ReLU, to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn a more complex mapping from inputs to outputs.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv(x)))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - **Flattening**: After the last convolutional block, the output is flattened into a 1D vector.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        x = self.flatten(x)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - **Fully connected layers**: The flattened vector is passed through fully connected layers, eventually producing a final output vector with `10` elements, corresponding to the 10 possible classes.\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        x = self.fc(x)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer model\n",
    "The Transformer model is a type of neural network architecture that excel at processing sequential data. Unlike previous models, transformers rely solely on attention mechanisms to capture relationships between data points. Key components:\n",
    "- **MultihHead self-attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing various aspects of the information.\n",
    "- **Positional encoding**: Adds information about the position of elements in the sequence, since the model doesn’t inherently understand sequence order.\n",
    "- **Feed-forward network (FFN)**: Applies a simple two-layer neural network to each position in the sequence independently.\n",
    "- **Layer normalization**: Normalizes inputs to each sub-layer to stabilize and speed up training.\n",
    "- **Residual connections**: Allows gradients to flow through the network directly, helping prevent vanishing gradients."

    "1. **Defining the positional encoding class**: PyTorch provides a built-in way to handle positional encodings when using the `nn.Transformer` and related modules. However, if we want to customize the positional encodings are generated and applied, we need to define a positional encoding class. Positional encoding allows the Transformer to incorporate the order of the sequence, which it otherwise would not know because of its parallel processing nature.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):\n",
    "      def __init__(self, d_model, max_len=5000):\n",
    "          super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__()\n",
    "          ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **`__init__(self, d_model, max_len=5000)`**: The constructor initializes the positional encoding matrix.\n",
    "    - **`d_model`**: Dimensionality of the model's hidden states, matching the size of each embedding vector.\n",
    "    - **`max_len`**: Maximum length of the sequence that the model can handle; this could be tuned based on the dataset.\n",
    "    - **Creating the positional encoding matrix**: It uses sine and cosine functions of different frequencies to generate a unique encoding for each position in the sequence.\n",
    "        - `position` is a tensor containing positions from `0` to `max_len - 1`.\n",
    "        - `div_term` is a scaling factor that ensures that the positional encoding vectors have a unique structure. It controls the frequencies of the sine and cosine functions.\n",
    "        - `pe` stores the positional encodings, with even indices filled with sine values and odd indices with cosine values. This encoding scheme helps to differentiate positions in the sequence.\n",
    "    - **`forward(self, x)`**: In the forward pass, the positional encoding tensor is added to the input embeddings (`x`). The positional encoding is broadcasted to match the batch size and sequence length.\n",

    "    - **Defining layers and operations**:\n",
    "        - **Embedding layer**: Converts input features (e.g., tokens in NLP, or features in a time series) into a higher-dimensional space to be processed by the Transformer.\n",

    "          self.embedding = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n",
    "          ```\n",
    "            - **`nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)`**: This linear layer takes the input features of size `input_size` and projects them into a space of size `hidden_size`. This is necessary because the Transformer model operates on vectors of a fixed dimension (i.e., `hidden_size`).\n",
    "        - **Positional encoding layer**: The positional encoding layer is defined using the `PositionalEncoding` class. It adds positional information to the embedded input sequences.\n",
    "            ```python\n",
    "            self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoding(hidden_size)\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            - **`PositionalEncoding(hidden_size)`**: This initializes the positional encoding with the same dimension as the embedding layer (`hidden_size`). The positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the order of elements in the sequence.\n",
    "        - **Transformer layer**: The transformer layer is the core of the model. It consists of stacked encoder and decoder layers that process the input sequences. Layer normalization is automatically handled within each Transformer layer before and after the self-attention and feedforward sub-layers to stabilize the training and make it faster.\n",

    "          ```\n",
    "            - **`d_model=hidden_size`**: The dimensionality of the model's hidden states, matching the embedding size (also called `hidden_size`).\n",
    "            - **`nhead`**: Number of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n",
    "            - **`num_encoder_layers`**: Number of encoder layers, each consisting of a self-attention mechanism followed by a feedforward neural network and layer normalization.\n",
    "            - **`num_decoder_layers`**: Number of decoder layers, similar to encoder layers but with an additional attention mechanism that focuses on the encoder's output.\n",
    "            - **`dim_feedforward`**: Dimensionality of the feedforward network inside the transformer layers. This feedforward network processes the output of the attention mechanism.\n",
    "            - **`dropout`**: Dropout rate, which helps in regularization by randomly setting some of the weights to zero during training.\n",
    "            - **`batch_first=True`**: Ensures the input and output tensors are ordered with the batch size as the first dimension in the format `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Fully connected layer: The fully connected layer is applied after the Transformer layers. It maps the final hidden state of the sequence to the desired output size.\n",

    "            self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)\n",

    "        - **Activation function** (`nn.Sigmoid()`): The activation function applied here is the sigmoid function, which is commonly used for binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Forward pass**: The forward pass defines how the input data moves through the network and gets transformed at each stage.\n",
