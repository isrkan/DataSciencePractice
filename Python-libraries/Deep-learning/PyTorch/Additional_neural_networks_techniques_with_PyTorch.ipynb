When we define dropout here, we are telling PyTorch to include a dropout layer as part of our model architecture. This setup ensures that dropout is a part of the model when it is initialized, which allows us to control the dropout rate and apply it consistently during training.\n",

It aims to keep the scale of the gradients similar across all layers. Weights are typically initialized from a distribution with zero mean and a variance of 2/(input units + output units). Typically used in networks with activation functions like `tanh` or `linear` or when we are unsure about the network's behavior and want a general-purpose initialization."

    "- **`__init__` method**: In PyTorch, the `__init__` method is where we define the architecture of our neural network. Normally, when we define layers in PyTorch (like `nn.Linear`), PyTorch automatically initializes the weights and biases of those layers using some default method. We donâ€™t need to explicitly create them as they are generated as part of the `nn.Linear` layer. However, sometimes we might want to customize this initialization process for better training performance. This is where adding custom initialization comes in, such as initialization functions or additional configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to customize initialization?**\n",
    "- **Accessing weights** (`self.fc.weight`): In the model class, we can access the weights of a layer directly by referring to them as `self.fc1.weight`, `self.fc2.weight`, etc. The `.weight` is an attribute of the `nn.Linear` object that stores the matrix of weights for that layer. Even though we didnâ€™t manually define `weight`, PyTorch did it for us under the hood when we created `self.fc`.\n",
    "- **Glorot initialization** (`nn.init.xavier_uniform_`): This method initializes the weights using a uniform distribution with bounds calculated to maintain the variance of gradients throughout the network.\n",
    "    - Adding lines like `nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.fc1.weight)` in the `__init__` method is how we can replace the default initialization with our custom one. Specifically, this line of code applies Glorot (Xavier) initialization to the weights of `self.fc1`. \n",
    "        - The `__init__` method is where we define the structure of our model. Weights Initialization is something we typically only need to do onceâ€”right after the layers are created. By putting it in the `__init__` method, we ensure that the custom initialization is applied every time we instantiate the model.\n",
