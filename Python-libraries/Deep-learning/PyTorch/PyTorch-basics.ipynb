    "# Introduction to PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a machine learning library. It is widely used for building deep learning models, particularly in research and academic settings. PyTorch provides a flexible and intuitive interface, making it easy to build and train neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic computation graph: PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs (also known as define-by-run), which allow us to change the network's behavior on the fly. This is particularly useful for research and when working with dynamic input sizes or data.\n",
    "- Pythonic: PyTorch is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Python ecosystem. Its syntax and usage are intuitive and align closely with native Python operations, making it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "- GPU acceleration: PyTorch supports hardware acceleration with GPUs, which allows for faster training of deep learning models. It is also easy to switch between CPU and GPU."

    "##### Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Example 1: scalar and tensor\n",
    "   - Rule applied: Scalars are automatically broadcast to any shape. This is because a scalar can be thought of as a tensor with shape `()`, and it can expand to match any tensor’s shape.\n",
    "   - Explanation: The scalar `5` is broadcast to match the shape of the tensor `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, which has a shape of `(2, 2)`. The scalar is conceptually expanded to a 2x2 tensor `[[5, 5], [5, 5]]` and then added element-wise, resulting in `[[6, 7], [8, 9]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example 2: Vector and matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Rule applied: When the dimensions are different, the smaller tensor (vector) is padded with ones on the left, turning `(3,)` into `(1, 3)`. The vector can then be broadcast across the matrix rows.\n",
    "   - Explanation: The vector `[10, 20, 30]` with shape `(3,)` is effectively reshaped to `(1, 3)` to match the shape of the matrix `(2, 3)`. It is then broadcast to match the matrix dimensions by replicating the vector along the new axis. This results in each row of the matrix having `[10, 20, 30]` added to it, yielding `[[11, 22, 33], [14, 25, 36]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example 3: Different shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Rule applied: One of the dimensions is 1. This allows `tensor2` to be broadcast along the second dimension of `tensor1`.\n",
    "   - Explanation: `tensor1` has shape `(3, 1)`, and `tensor2` has shape `(3,)`. The shape `(3,)` is interpreted as `(1, 3)`. The first dimension of `tensor1` matches, and the second dimension is broadcast by expanding `tensor2` across each row. This results in adding `tensor2` to each row of `tensor1`, resulting in a shape of `(3, 3)`, where the output is `[[11, 12, 13], [22, 23, 24], [33, 34, 35]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Example 4: Broadcasting with explicit reshaping\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Rule applied: Reshaping helps manually adjust dimensions to fit broadcasting rules.\n",
    "   - Explanation: `tensor1` has shape `(2, 2)`, and `tensor2` has shape `(2,)`, which we reshape to `(2, 1)` to align with the first dimension of `tensor1`. Now `tensor2_reshaped` can be broadcast to `(2, 2)`. Each element of `tensor2_reshaped` is broadcasted across the columns of `tensor1`. The operation adds the reshaped `tensor2` to each column, resulting in `[[11, 12], [23, 24]]`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Reshaping tensors\n",
    "Reshaping tensors in PyTorch allows us to change the shape of a tensor without altering its data. This is often necessary when preparing data for model input or when manipulating data to perform specific operations. A tensor's shape describes the size of each dimension. Reshaping involves changing the dimensions while keeping the total number of elements constant. PyTorch provides several functions for reshaping tensors, including `torch.reshape()` and `torch.view()`."

    "- `torch.reshape(tensor, shape)`\n",
    "  - `tensor`: The tensor to reshape.\n",
    "  - `shape`: A tuple specifying the new shape.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `tensor.view(*shape)`\n",
    "  - `shape`: A tuple specifying the new shape. Like `torch.reshape()`, the total number of elements must remain the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Explanations\n",
    "1. Example 1: Flattening a tensor involves converting a multi-dimensional tensor into a 1D tensor. This is useful when we need to feed data into a neural network layer that requires a vector input. The shape `(-1,)` automatically infers the size needed to flatten the tensor into a 1D array, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.\n",
    "2. Example 2: We can change the dimensions of a tensor, provided the total number of elements remains the same. The original tensor with shape `(6,)` is reshaped to `(2, 3)`, resulting in a 2D tensor `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.\n",
    "3. Example 3: Adding a new dimension can be useful for adjusting the shape to fit model input requirements. The tensor is reshaped from `(2, 3)` to `(2, 3, 1)`, adding a new dimension without changing the total number of elements.\n",
    "4. Example 4: The `-1` in the shape allows PyTorch to infer the appropriate size for that dimension. The original tensor with shape `(2, 2, 2)` is reshaped to `(2, 4)`, where `-1` infers the second dimension.\n",
